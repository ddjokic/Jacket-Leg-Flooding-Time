<h4>Calculating flooding time of jacket leg due to diaphragm rupture</h4>

Script "**floodingjacket_leg.py**" had been downloaded long time ago and forked on the road. If you know the author or you are the author, please, let me know to give proper credit to the author.</p>
Jacket legs are, in general, designed with safety factor of 2 to hydrostatic pressure. Rapture may appear during offshore installation. As inital rupture area may be increased over time of flooding, always consider **average rupture area as input**.</p>
<h5>Requirements to run script</h5>
**inout.py** should be located in your PythonPath. </p>
"inout.py" may be downloaded [here.](https://github.com/ddjokic/Python-Bin)</p>

Script comes with **ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY**.
